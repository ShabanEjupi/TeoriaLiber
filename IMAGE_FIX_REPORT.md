# ðŸ”§ Image Integration Fix Report

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Duplicate Images in Chapter 2**
- **Problem**: Chapter 2 was showing images twice due to multiple conflicting image integration scripts
- **Solution**: Removed hardcoded image galleries from `script.js` and consolidated all image handling into a single `fixed-image-integration.js` file

### 2. **Wrong Images Being Displayed**
- **Problem**: Images weren't corresponding to their intended chapters
- **Solution**: Created a proper chapter-to-image mapping system with correct paths:
  - Chapter 1: Book cover image
  - Chapter 2: Business strategy scene 
  - Chapter 3: Investment analysis scene
  - And so on... (50 chapters total mapped)

### 3. **Image Paths Showing as Text**
- **Problem**: Instead of actual images, users were seeing text like "Feature chess pieces on a marble board..."
- **Solution**: 
  - Cleaned up all text containing image prompts
  - Replaced broken image elements
  - Added proper image loading with fallback handling

### 4. **Multiple Conflicting Scripts**
- **Problem**: Multiple scripts (`image-fix.js`, `image-display-fix.js`, `enhanced-image-integration.js`) were conflicting
- **Solution**: 
  - Created single source of truth: `fixed-image-integration.js`
  - Updated `index.html` to use only the fixed integration script
  - Removed hardcoded galleries from `script.js`

## Files Modified:

1. **`fixed-image-integration.js`** - NEW: Complete image integration system
2. **`index.html`** - Updated script references
3. **`script.js`** - Removed conflicting image code and hardcoded galleries
4. **`styles.css`** - Added styling for content notices
5. **`test-image-integration-fix.html`** - NEW: Test file to verify fixes

## Technical Implementation:

### Proper Image Mapping:
```javascript
const imageMap = {
    1: 'imazhet/book-cover.png',
    2: 'imazhet/business-strategy.jpg',
    // ... 50 chapters total
};
```

### Clean Integration:

### CSS Enhancements:
